# MyVimrc
This file is my vimrc in linux terminal using. I use it in my Ubuntu 14.04 terminal.

Because some of setting about vimrc in termial is distinguish with Gvim in desktop, so I stress that it is used in the vim of terminal. If you willing to use Gvim, please be careful in use of my vimrc.

I also set my bashrc in this repo, you can delete it if you don't need it.

molokai.vim is my favourite theme in vim.

- mv `vim/` to your home directory and rename it with `.vim/`;

- mv `vimrc` to your home directory and rename it with `.vimrc`;

- if you like, you can mv `bashrc` to your home directory and rename it with `.bashrc`, replace your old `.bashrc` and then `source .bashrc` of it;

- by the way, you SHOULD be read .vimrc, and complete some other operation because vim plugin-manager vundle and many other plugins should be installed;

- please be attention to some plugins, they probably let your vim break down when you boot your vim with this vimrc, be clearly of contents in .vimrc;

- you should be install some other software in your linux system for some of excited plugins depend on them.
