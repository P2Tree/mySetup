# MyVimrc
This file is my vimrc in linux terminal using. I use it in my Ubuntu 14.04 terminal.

Because some of setting about vimrc in termial is distinguish with Gvim in desktop, so I stress that it is used in the vim of terminal. If you willing to use Gvim, please be careful in use of my vimrc.

I also set my bashrc in this repo, you can delete it if you don't need it.

molokai.vim is my favourite theme in vim.
